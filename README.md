# Why I Created This Script

As an active member of various Termux communities, I noticed many users struggled to set up clean, functional Termux environments or to install complex tools like Blutter and Radare2. The process was often confusing,timeconsuming, and frustrating especially for beginners.

This script was created to simplify all of that. It’s meant to be a onestop solution that guides users through setup and customization with ease, saving time and minimizing hassle.
If you’ve already customized your Termux setup extensively, this script might not be necessary for you. But for anyone starting fresh, it’s a great way to get up and running quickly and confidently.

A Quick Note
What began as a small Python script to speed up my own installations evolved into this comprehensive tool after much testing and refinement. Though I only worked on it parttime, I’m proud of the result and hope it helps many users get their Termux environments ready faster and with less frustration.
